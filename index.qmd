## Featured Projects

### [Ball Python Morphs Identifierüêç](https://huggingface.co/spaces/samfhy/ball-python-morph-identifier)
I used to keep pet snakes, so I built a classifier model that can identify the different morphs carried by a ball python. Snakes are incredibly cute and beautiful!

### [Solar SaversüåÖ](https://dsci-532-2024-9-solar-savers.onrender.com/)
A dashboard that shows how much you could save on energy with solar panels, especially helpful if you're in Alberta, Saskatchewan, or Manitoba, where there's tons of sunshine. I had to calculate all these numbers to decide if it's worth it to install solar panels for my old family house.
