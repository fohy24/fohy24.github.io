# My Projects

Welcome to my collection of passion projects. Click on any link below to view the live dashboards!

## Featured Projects

### [Ball Python Morphs Identifier](https://huggingface.co/spaces/samfhy/ball-python-morph-identifier)
I used to keep pet snakes, so I built a classifier model that can identify the different morphs carried by a ball python. Snakes are incredibly cute and beautiful :)

### [Solar Savers](https://dsci-532-2024-9-solar-savers.onrender.com/)
A  dashboard that shows how much you could save on energy with solar panels, especially helpful if you're in Alberta, Saskatchewan, or Manitoba, where there's tons of sunshine.
